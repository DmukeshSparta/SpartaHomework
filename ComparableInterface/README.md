# Comparable Interface 

Create a comparable interface by creating two inferace: CompareByName and CompareByLength and which accepts two strings and 
ompares them both alphabetically and also by length.

The output should read something like
'String1 is above/below/the same as String2 alphabetically'
'String1 is shorter/longer/the same length compared to String2'
